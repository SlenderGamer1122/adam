im sorry for the missing screenshots, beacause i misused the command /clear and i didnt have time to rewrite all the commands and take screenshots, but the job is done, and now i know how to use the basic commands, like git add . git init 
git log, git status, git commit -m "   " , git clone.. git push, git pull, touch , git remote add origin.. etc
